# Homepod USB Breakout Simple
This is a simpler version of the USB Breakout. If you do not require UART and/or you want to solder through hole components instead, make this board.
It uses a USB B connector as it is simple to solder.

If you would like to access UART, you can via the pin headers. Note that UART is 1.8V and _NOT_ 3.3V compatible.
